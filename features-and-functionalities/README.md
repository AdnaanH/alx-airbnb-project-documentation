# üìö Airbnb Clone ‚Äî Backend Project Requirements

Identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend by understanding the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.

## üìù Introduction

Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application.
This document outlines the backend requirements for the **Airbnb Clone** project, focusing on features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements are categorized into:

* **Core Functionalities**
* **Technical Requirements**
* **Non-Functional Requirements**

  * Price range
  * Number of guests
  * Amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)

* Include pagination for large datasets.

### 4. Booking Management

* **Booking Creation**

  * Guests can book properties for specific dates.
  * Prevent double bookings through date validation.

* **Booking Cancellation**

  * Guests and hosts can cancel bookings based on cancellation policies.

* **Booking Status Tracking**

  * Track statuses: pending, confirmed, canceled, completed.

### 5. Payment Integration

* Implement secure payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) for:

  * Guest payments
  * Automatic host payouts

* Support multiple currencies.

### 6. Reviews and Ratings

* Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
* Hosts can respond to reviews.
* Ensure reviews are linked to completed bookings.

### 7. Notifications System

* Implement email and in-app notifications for:

  * Booking confirmations
  * Cancellations
  * Payment updates

### 8. Admin Dashboard

* Provide an admin interface to manage:

  * Users
  * Listings
  * Bookings
  * Payments

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

* Use a relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
* Required tables:

  * Users
  * Properties
  * Bookings
  * Reviews
  * Payments

### 2. API Development

* Build RESTful APIs with:

  * Proper HTTP methods and status codes (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE)

* Optionally, use **GraphQL** for complex data fetching scenarios.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

* Use **JWT** for secure sessions.
* Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for:

  * Guests
  * Hosts
  * Admins

### 4. File Storage

* Store property images and user profile photos.
* Use cloud storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary)
  **For this project: file storage will be used.**

* Use email services (SendGrid, Mailgun) for notifications.

### 6. Error Handling and Logging

* Implement global error handling for APIs.
* Ensure consistent and clear error responses.

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability

* Use modular architecture for easy scaling.
* Enable horizontal scaling with load balancers.

### 2. Security

* Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, payments).
* Implement firewalls and rate limiting.

### 3. Performance Optimization

* Use caching tools (Redis) for faster responses (e.g., search results).
* Optimize database queries to reduce load.

### 4. Testing

* Implement unit and integration tests (e.g., using **Pytest**).
* Include automated API testing to ensure reliability.
